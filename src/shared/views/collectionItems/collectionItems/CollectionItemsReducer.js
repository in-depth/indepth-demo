With a combat load, GW displaces almost 97,000 long tons (99,000 t) and can accommodate 6,250 crewmembers. Her four distilling units can make 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500,000 L) of potable water a day; the food service divisions serve 18,000 meals per day. There are over 2,500 compartments on board requiring 2,520 refrigeration tons (8.6 MW) of air conditioning capacity (enough to cool over 2,000 homes).',

In 1993, following a fleet reorganization, the Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2 staff went aboard a new flagship, George Washington. In 1994 the group was under the command of Rear Admiral Alexander Krekich. The group participated in the 2000 NATO Exercise Destined Glory, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Deny Flight, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Vigilant Resolve.[3] After 2001 the group took part in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 1997 Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2, Rear Admiral Michael Mullen, led the group on deployment from George Washington.',

The discovery was announced on 16 May 2014. The remains were initially discovered in 2011 by a farm laborer, in the desert near La Flecha, about 250 km west of Trelew.[4] Excavation was done by palaeontologists from the Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio. The lead scientists on the excavation were Jose Luis Carballido and Diego Pol, with partial funding from The Jurassic Foundation. Seven partial skeletons, consisting of approximately 150 bones, were uncovered, and described as in remarkable condition .',
